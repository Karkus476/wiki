SuperTux is a classic 2D jump'n run sidescroller game in a style similar to the original SuperMario games. The Milestone1 release of SuperTux features 9 enemies, 26 playable levels, software and OpenGL rendering modes, configurable joystick and keyboard input, new music and completely redone graphics. Together with a little story, we hope to provide a good gaming experience with this first Milestone release.

The improvements in Milestone1 are in huge part the result of the work done surrounding the [http://www.happypenguin.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1240 Game of the Month March 2004] event on [http://www.happypenguin.org/ happypenguin.org].

If you have paid for SuperTux, you have been ripped off. Supertux is available for free download at [[Download|Download/Installation]].
